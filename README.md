# BankManagementSystem

🚀 Built a Bank Management System using Java Swing & MVC! 🏦
Excited to share my latest project—a Bank Management System, a desktop application built using Java Swing, following the MVC architecture for a well-structured and scalable design.

🔹 Features:

 ✅ User Authentication – Secure login & signup
 
 ✅ Account Management – View balance, deposit, Transfer, and withdraw funds
 
 ✅ Profile Update – Users can update their email, phone, and address
 
 ✅ Transaction History – View all past transactions
 
 ✅ Clean Architecture – DAO, Service, and MVC layers for maintainability
 
 ✅ Database Integration – Data stored using MySQL
 
💡 Tech Stack:

 🔸 Java Swing – UI for desktop application
 
 🔸 JDBC & MySQL – Handling data storage & retrieval
 
 🔸 MVC Architecture – Separating concerns for better maintainability
 

This project helped me improve my skills in Java, UI development, database integration, and software design patterns.
